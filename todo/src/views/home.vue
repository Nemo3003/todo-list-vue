        A todo app is a digital tool that helps you manage your tasks and stay organized.
         It allows you to create, view, edit, and track your to-do lists using your computer, smartphone, 
         or tablet. With a todo app, you can easily add new tasks, set deadlines, assign priorities, 
         and even categorize your tasks by project or topic. Some todo apps also come with features such as reminders,
          progress tracking, and collaboration tools that let you share your lists with others and work together 
          on common goals. Overall, a todo app can be a great productivity booster, enabling you to focus on what 
          matters most and achieve your goals efficiently.
